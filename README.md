# Microsoft Industry Links

There are many options for Microsoft partners when creating solutions to transfer data into and out of the [Microsoft Cloud for Industry](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/) products. To assist, this repository has created a set of quick start templates to be a starting point for partners with a guidance on technology choice on the most common patterns seen to date.

The intent is to minimize the friction for partners to create solutions for Microsoft Cloud for Industry and over time, we expect to add more patterns as required.

## What's Included

- MsIndustryLinks PowerShell module that supports:
  - Configuration and creation of custom connectors
  - Generation of Power Automate & Logic App workflow templates
  - Packaging of workflows into a deployable solution
  - Generation of ready-to-publish offer listings in Partner Center (AppSource and Azure Marketplace)

See [MsIndustryLinks](scripts/modules/MsIndustryLinks/README.md) reference for more information on the cmdlets available for this module.
